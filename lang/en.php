        facilities where a shallow foundation was not possible. When digging tunnels at the entrance or exit
        in some places galleries were made on piles to enable the execution of portal constructions. It was a great pleasure and challenge for our team to participate in the realization of this project.",

Only after acceptance of the proposal by the contractor works on the previous section and unification of the Zenica tunnel on the Ponirak - Vraca subsection and the tunnel Vraca on the sub-section Vraca - Donja Gračanica comes to the fore and is currently one of the longest tunnels on this Corridor.

The specificity of this project is the roundabout on intersections of Azize Šaćirbegović, Zvornička, Safet Hadžića and transit streets as well as regulation of pedestrian movement in the zone of the same, which was done by making a central circular underpass with a light dome in the middle and five tunnels whose branches connect all the surrounding settlements. All these activities had to be performed without disruption of traffic participants and without long-term interruption of city traffic.

It is valid for one of the more complex sections of the Corridor. It is also characterized by the fact that, during the execution of this section, many domestic companies were involved in realization of the project, thus gaining the conditions for further competition in the award of similar jobs.
